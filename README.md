# Developer Health Study

Once the survey is closed and the data has been tabulated, it will be available here in both raw and synthesized formats (qualitative questions quantified).

The Issue:
Physical and mental health in the development community is a commonly overlooked and under-discussed topic. We know how lines of work impact the body, take construction for example, and it is important to monitor this for the growing tech space. We need to take a more in-depth look at the development community.

Research Design:
The primary source of data will be an open survey targeted at the development community. There will also be follow up interviews for those interested in participating to share more about their personal experiences.

Benefit:
This research will provide an in-depth look at workstyles, routines, and impacts in the technicals space. It will help to inform the development community as well as employers. 

Data distribution:
All of the data will be opensources aside from anypersonally identifiable information.
